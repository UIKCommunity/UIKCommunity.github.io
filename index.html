                        BN Khaldoun Community is a community intended for collaboration and learning in the student
                        community. We value the participation of each member of the student community and want all
                        attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience.

                        This Code of Conduct looks at the actions of IBN Khaldoun community members, students, open
                        source projects, events and code repositories and since we are humans and a local community, we
                        can fall into communication problems and discontent. That's why we have placed some basic rules,
                        which we require our members to consider, to get a pleasant environment, lead to communication,
                        collaboration, and sharing.

                        Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees
                        throughout the Events. To make clear what is expected, all attendees and speakers at this Events
                        are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers and University of IBN
                        Khaldoun officials will enforce this code throughout the event.
