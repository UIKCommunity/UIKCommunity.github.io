            <h2 style="margin: 12;">Introduction</h2>
            <p>IBN Khaldoun Community is a community intended for collaboration and learning in the student community. We value the participation of each member of the student community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience.<br><br>This
                Code of Conduct looks at the actions of IBN Khaldoun community members, students, open source projects, events and code repositories and since we are humans and a local community, we can fall into communication problems and discontent.
                That's why we have placed some basic rules, which we require our members to consider, to get a pleasant environment, lead to communication, collaboration, and sharing.<br><br>Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and
                courtesy to other attendees throughout the Events. To make clear what is expected, all attendees and speakers at this Events are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers and University of IBN Khaldoun officials
                will enforce this code throughout the event.<br></p>
            <h2>The code<br></h2>
            <p>All participants in these events must abide by the following Code:<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Be respectful:</span></strong> We do not all have the same opinions. However, disagreement in no way excuses bad behavior
                or execrable manners. We all experience frustration from time to time. However, it must not turn into a personal attack. Remember, if community members do not feel comfortable or confident, it will not be productive.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Be benevolent:</span></strong>                Your work will be used by other people and you will also have to use the work of others. So you will have to make a mindset of open sharing.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Be kind:</span></strong> All members
                of the Ibn Khaldoun community must feel accepted, regardless of their situation. Be courteous, respectful and polite to other members.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Communicate effectively:</span></strong> We
                do not all have the same level of knowledge. To avoid misunderstandings, communicate clearly. We do not all come from the same background and, therefore, we can interpret the words differently.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Post New Ideas:</span></strong>                Always post new ideas for project, event, and talks, this will have a great impact on other members to think differently.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Be excellent to each other: </span></strong>The Organizers
                want the events to be an excellent experience for everyone regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, or
                other protected category. Treat everyone with respect. Participate while acknowledging that everyone deserves to be at the event -- and each of us has the right to enjoy the experience without fear of harassment, discrimination, or condescension,
                whether blatant or via micro-aggressions. Jokes shouldn’t demean others. Consider what you are saying and how it would feel if it were said to or about you.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Speak up if you see or hear something:&nbsp;</span></strong>Harassment
                is not tolerated, and you are empowered to politely engage when you or others are disrespected. The person making you feel uncomfortable may not be aware of what they are doing, and politely bringing their behavior to their attention is
                encouraged. If a participant engages in harassing or uncomfortable behavior, the Organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning or expelling the offender from the event with no refund. If you are being harassed
                or feel uncomfortable, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the event staff immediately.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Harassment is not tolerated:</span></strong>                Harassment includes, but is not limited to: verbal language that reinforces social structures of domination related to gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity,
                nationality, race, age, religion, or other protected category; sexual imagery in public spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; offensive
                verbal language; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">And finaly:</span></strong>&nbsp;Participants
                asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If participants fail to comply they will be asked to leave the event.<br><br>Be careful and mindful of the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and
                other exclusionary comments and hacks can be offensive to those around you.<br><br>If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the event organizers will take any action they deem appropriate, including warning
                the offender or expulsion from the events.</p>
